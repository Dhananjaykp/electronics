Project Name : Digital Clock uning Electronics Components 

Domain: built using Electronics components

Description: It is digital clock which display time on 7-segment display 

Components used 
1.  CD4060 X2
2.  CD4026 X6
3.  74LS00 X1
4.  Resistors:10k ohm, 330ohm 330k ohm
5.  Capacitor: 30pf
6.  Zener Diode: 1N4148
7.  Crystal osicillator 32.768khz
8.  push button x2
9.  7-segment Display
10.  transistor BC548
11.  Breadbord

It is a group project. There was four memmber in the group 
The project have four parts 
1. pulse generation : In pulse generation. I used two cd4060 ic : It is a CMOS integrated circuit that functions as a 14- stage binrary ripple counter, Capacitor 30pfregistor:  10k ohm, 330ohm 330k ohm
2. MOD 60: its second
3. MOD 60 : its display minutes
4. MOD 12 : its display hours


  My role was in the project is to build pulse generation part 

  challenge: challenge I faced that the minutes display was not working
